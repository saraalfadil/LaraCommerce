## LaraCommerce
A simple e-commerce manager built using Laravel PHP framework. The application currently has the ability to manage products and categories from the administrative area. This is a work in progress so I will be consistently adding new features & functionality.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. To set up dependencies, run `composer install && npm install`.
4. Run `gulp` to compile SCSS files & autoprefix CSS3 properties.
5. Create a database called `laracommerce`.
6. Run `php artisan migrate` & `php artisan db:seed` to add seed data.
